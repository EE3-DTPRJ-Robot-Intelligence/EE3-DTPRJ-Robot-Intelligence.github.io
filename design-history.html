                    <h2>Concept</h2>
                        <p>Our approach was to identify and investigate sensors that can be used to extract useful data from the robots and
                        enhance their functionality, before integrating them to the robots.</p>

                    <h2>Specification</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Measure the force on the foot of SLIDER.</li>
                            <li>Make SLIDER run at walking speed.</li>
                            <li>Measure the acceleration and movement of robots.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that a robot will be able to detect changes in elevation in front of it.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that a robot stops when it encounter obstacles around it.</li>
                            <li>Monitor temperature of motors driving robots.</li>
                            <li>Determine the location of robots.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                        <p> Our team did our research online to determine the best method to address the client requirements, namely:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Decide which type of sensor to use for each task</li>
                                <li>For each type of sensors, compare available choices on market to determine their suitability to our project, in terms of functionality and cost etc.</li>
                            </ul>
                            We have also consulted the PhD students of the lab who have had more experience in robotics.</p>
                        <h3>Research outcomes</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Load sensors (Phidget) can be used to measure forces applied on it.</li>
                                <li>After familiarising with the specification on the ODrive website, we managed to identify ways to make SLIDER run
                                    at walking speed. </li>
                                <li>An inertial measurement unit (IMU) provides a way of tracking an object's acceleration and movement.</li>
                                <li>2 possible methods were identified: using a laser and an IR proximity sensor as both are able to measure distances.
                                    The IR was chosen as it was low cost.</li>
                                <li>Ultrasonic sensors was chosen over lasers as it is able to detect glass or window panes. The trade off is that sound travels
                                    at a lower speed than light.</li>
                                <li>2 possible methods were identified: a thermistor and a thermocouple. A thermocouple was chosen over thermistor as
                                    it is more accurate and it operates over a wider range of temperature. </li>
                                <li>Adding a GPS will allow the location of a robot to be determined.</li>
                            </ol>

                    <h2>Implementation and build</h2>
                        <p> We implemented the sensors with Arduinos, mbeds as well as building circuits as required. Then, code was written to enable the
                        the information to be displayed on a computer. </p>
