                    <h2>Concept</h2>
                        <p>Our approach was to identify and investigate sensors that can be used to extract useful data from the robots and
                        enhance their functionality, before integrating them to the robots.</p>

                    <h2>Specification</h2>
                        <h3>Client requirements:</h3>
                        <p> 1. Measure the force on the foot of SLIDER.</p>
                        <p> 2. Make SLIDER run at walking speed.</p>
                        <p> 3. Measure the acceleration and movement of robots.</p>
                        <p> 4. Ensure that a robot will be able to detect changes in elevation in front of it.</p>
                        <p> 5. Ensure that a robot stops when it encounter obstacles around it.</p>
                        <p> 6. Monitor temperature of motors driving robots.</p>
                        <p> 7. Determine the locality of robots.</p>


                    <h2>Research</h2>
                        <p> Our team did our research online to determine the best method to address the client requirements. We too consulted
                            the PhD students present in the lab who have had more experience in robotics.</p>
                        <h3>Research outcomes:</h3>
                        <p> 1. Load sensors (Phidget) can be used to measure forces applied on it.</p>
                        <p> 2. After familiarising with the specification on the ODrive website, we managed to identify ways to make SLIDER run
                            at walking speed. </p>
                        <p> 3. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) provides a way of tracking an object's acceleration and movement.</p>
                        <p> 4. 2 possible methods were identified: using a laser and an IR proximity sensor as both are able to measure distances.
                            The IR was chosen as it was low cost.</p>
                        <p> 5. Ultrasonic sensors was chosen over lasers as it is able to detect glass or window panes. The trade off is that sound travels
                            at a lower speed than light.</p>
                        <p> 6. 2 possible methods were identified: a thermistor and a thermocouple. A thermocouple was chosen over thermistor as
                            it is more accurate and it operates over a wider range of temperature. </p>
                        <p> 7. Adding a GPS will allow the location of a robot to be determined.</p>

                    <h2>Implementation and Build</h2>
                        <p> We implemented the sensors with Arduinos, mbeds as well as building circuits as required. Then, code was written to enable the
                        the information to be displayed on a computer. </p>
