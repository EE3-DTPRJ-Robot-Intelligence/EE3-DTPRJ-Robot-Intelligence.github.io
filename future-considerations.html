                    <h2>Sustainability</h2>
                        <p>The SLIDER project is a long term project designed and carried out by Robot Intelligence Lab. There have been a few short-term project groups from different departments which have contributed to the robot project.
                            It is very important that future researchers in the lab are able to continue our work easily. Our group aims to aid future research by providing existing prototypes with additional sensing capabilities as well as
                            laying out the basic framework (code, circuits) for future implementation. Documentation and GitHub resources are provided to allow easy usage and modification. </p>

                    <h2>Ethical consequences</h2>
                        <p>Many believe that artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics will be widely adopted in the near future,
                            and such trend has already been observed. The SLIDER project, amongst all similar projects in
                            the world that focuses on bipedal walking robots, provides a unique design and is a great attempt
                            to push the technology even further. However, there is also a concern that robots can
                            go wrong and create chaos to the society. Some are even afraid that robots will be used as weapons
                            to harm human beings. Even though the discussions of such concerns may be off topic in this specific
                            group project, it is indeed a serious topic that must be addressed. As engineers we believe that
                            it is almost impossible to slow down the development of such technologies or eliminate the dangers inherent
                            in them. However, attention can be paid to the development of AI security technology. Companies
                            must put a lot of work into developing secure robot systems which ensures that any collateral damage is
                            minimised.
