                    <h2>Sustainability</h2>
                        <p>The slider project is a long term project designed and carried out by Robot Intelligence Lab. There has been a few short-term project groups from different departments that have contributed to the implementation of the robot. 
                            It is very important that future researches in the lab are able to carry on our work easily without further investigation. Our group aims to provide quality implementation of sensors to the robot to acheive sustainlability 
                            and so as to provide a robust and multi-functional prototype for future researches to be carried out. Documentation and github resources are also provided to allow easy usage and modification. </p>
                        <h3>Future work</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Integrate all the sensors in a software environment using ROS (Robot Operating System).</li>
                                <li>Research of artificial intelligence and machine learning.</li>
                                <li>Perform experiments on SLIDER.</li>
                            </ul>

                    <h2>Ethical consequences</h2>
                        <p>Many believe that artificial intelligence and robotics will be widely adopted in the near future, 
                            and such trend has already been observed. The slider project, among all the similar projects in 
                            the world that focus on bipedal walking robots, provides a unique design and is a great atempt 
                            to push the techonlogy even further. However, there is also a rising concern about how robots can
                            go wrong and create chaos to the society. Some are even afraid that robots will be used as weapons
                            to harm human beings. Even though the discussions of such concerns may be off topics in this specific 
                            group project, it is indeed a serious topic that must be addressed. As engineers we believe that 
                            it is almost impossible to slow or stop the development of such overwhelming 
                            technology. However, attention can be paid to the development of A.I security technology. Companies
                            must put a lot of work on developing security systems and keep it as strong as possible.
